	INNOTRANS will provide an opportunity to present key results, e.g. modelling tools and simulators. INNOTRANS, the world's largest trade fair for railways and public transit, addressing the entire railway industry, will take place in combination with an international conference at one of the participation universities (e.g., TU Braunschweig) covering scientific aspects and project results, addressing more the academic world. Since several openETCS partners like Alstom, Deutsche Bahn, ERSA, ERTMS-Solutions, General Electric, Siemens, SNCF, etc. are regularly represented at that industrial fair, the openETCS subject could featured specifically at their particular exhibition having a best possible outreach to make the approach well known.
