\subsection{openETCS Website}
With the start of the project a preliminary public project website has been set up and can be reached under \url{http://www.openetcs.org}. In its current state the website gives a brief overview over the project, its goals, and the participating partners. Moreover, a calendar with upcoming events gives people not yet involved but interested in the project an overview of ongoing activities and thus the possibility to participate in these events. Last but not least the website provides links to the project github repository, thus providing access to deliverables, software, meeting minutes, etc.

It is planned to go online with a redesigned and revised website within this year. The revised website will among other things provide more information about the participating partners and each of the working packages.
