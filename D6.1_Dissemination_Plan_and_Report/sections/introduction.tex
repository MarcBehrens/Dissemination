\section{Introduction}

This document is the first version of the openETCS dissemination plan and report. It represents a preliminary version of the project dissemination strategy and covers past and as well as planned dissemination activities.

The document is structured as follows. Section \ref{sct:past_activities} lists dissemination activities such as talks and articles that have taken place / were published already. Details like date, publisher and/or venue as well as contributors and an abstract are provided. In the Sections \ref{sct:exhibitions}, \ref{sct:ext_conferences} and \ref{sct:journals} we list planned future dissemination opportunities and events categorised by their type (conference, exhibition, journal, etc.). For each of those items we provide the planned contribution(s) and the relevance for the project.

Section \ref{sct:openetcs_events} lists events to be organised by the openETCS project that provide a significant dissemination potential. Sections \ref{sct:open_source} and \ref{sct:further_activities} focus on the open source activities, a central aspect of openETCS and additional dissemination activities not covered by the other sections, respectively.
