\section{Introduction}

This document is the first version of the openETCS dissemination plan and report. It represents a preliminary version of the project dissemination strategy and covers past and as well as planned dissemination activities.

The document is structured as follows. In the Sections \ref{sct:exhibitions}, \ref{sct:ext_conferences} and \ref{sct:journals} we list past dissemination activities and publications as well as future opportunities and events. The individual items are classified by their status (past activities/publications or planned future activity) and their type (conference, exhibition, journal, etc.). For past items details like date, publisher and/or venue as well as contributors and an abstract are listed, whereas for planned events we mention the interested partners and a description together with the planned contribution and/or justification of the relevance for the project.

Section \ref{sct:openetcs_events} lists events organised by the openETCS project that provide a significant dissemination potential. In Section \ref{sct:standardisation} we present our current plans regarding standardisation of project results.

Sections \ref{sct:open_source}, \ref{sct:further_activities} and \ref{sct:communication} focus on the open source activities, a central aspect of openETCS, additional dissemination activities not covered by the other sections and the means of communication within the project and with the outside world, respectively.
