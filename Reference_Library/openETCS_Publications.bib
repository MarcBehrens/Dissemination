	abstract = {This document describes the research results that were obtained from the development of
safety-critical software under the principles of open source. Different model-based designs
and architectures within the railway control system application domain, including re-usable
formalisms for verification \& validation, were investigated. The reduction of possible security
threats caused by platform or supplier specific adaptations of modelled open-core software was
analysed, and a possible solution by the usage of hardware virtualisation, instead of traditional
memory management, was elaborated. At core of this work, the development of a graphical
domain-specific language for modelling parts of the European Train Control System ({ETCS)} is
presented, which is based on specialised data, control flow formalisms, and language elements
derived from the specification document. For a more precise and therefore more appropriate
syntax definition for safety-critical systems, the already existing {GOPRR} meta meta model was
extended to the newly developed {GOPPRR} meta meta model. {GOPPRR} includes methods for
defining constraints by the object constraint language, which supports the definition of static
semantics to ensure correct model instances. Parts of the {ETCS} specification related to the
train on-board unit were modelled in a new meta model. To transform the developed model of
the {ETCS} specification into an executable application, a domain framework, according to the
new meta model and the corresponding code generator, were designed and implemented, which
have implicitly an integrated support for the verification \& validation process. To proof the
correctness of the modelled specification, the resulting application was executed in a simulative
environment to obtain simulation traces. The correspondence of traces to the expected data
from the specification document supported the used methods and strategies in this dissertation
as proof of concept.},

	abstract = {Using the {openETCS} initiative as a starting point, we describe how open software can be applied in combination with platform-specific, potentially closed- source extensions, in the development, verification, validation and certification of safety-critical railway control systems. We analyse the safety and security threats presented by this approach and discuss conventional operating system partitioning mechanisms, as well as virtualisation methods with respect to their potential to over- come these problems. Furthermore, we advocate a shift from open source to open models, in order to increase the development efficiency of combined open and pro- prietary solutions},
